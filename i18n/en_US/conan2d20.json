  "CONAN.conditionDescriptionBlin": "The character's vision is severly damaged. Upon being blinded, a character suffers 3 d6 mental damage, and any skill test reliant on vision (normally Observation, Insight, Ranged Weapons, Sailing, etc.) increases in DIfficulty by two steps.",
  "CONAN.conditionDescriptionBurn": "The target is set on fire. This condition lasts for a number of rounds equal to the number of Effects rolled on the attack that inflicted it. If no d6 were rolled, the cause of the Burning effect will list a duration. At the end of the target's turn, the target suffers X d6 physical and mental damage (roll once, apply for both), ignoring Armor Soak. Any physical damage caused by Burning X has the Incendiary attack Quality, and Effects rolled increase the number of rounds that the character remains aflame. A character may attempt a Clear Minor Action to remove this effect, while a prone character can spend a Standard Action rolling around, extinguishing the flames. The latter works as a Clear Action but reduces the Difficulty by two steps. If the character is hit by another Burning attack or effect while already ablaze, the existing status is extended by a number of rounds equal to the number of Effects rolled.",
  "CONAN.conditionDescriptionDaze": "All skill tests performed by a Dazed character increase in Difficulty by one step until the Dazed condition ends.",
  "CONAN.conditionDescriptionDeaf": "The character's hearing has been severely damaged. Upon being deafened, a character suffers 3 d6 mental damage, and any skill test reliant on hearing (normally Observation, Insight, Command, Persuade, etc.) increases in Difficulty by two steps.",
  "CONAN.conditionDescriptionHind": "The character's movement is hindered, slowing them. The character cannot attempt any movement as a Free Action. Further, the character may only move to within Close range as a Minor Action move, and only to within Medium range as a Standard Action move. Finally, the Difficulty of all terrain tests is increased by one step for the character.",
  "CONAN.conditionDescriptionPois": "The character's body suffers the effects of some form of vile toxin. While each poison has a specific effect, the general effect is to grant the character the Staggered condition.",
  "CONAN.conditionDescriptionStag": "A staggered character can only perform a Standard Action in a turn if the player is willing to pay 1 point of Doom. A staggered character cannot perform a Reaction unless spending 1 Fortune point in addition to the reaction's normal Doom cost.",

  "CONAN.qualitiesDescriptionArea": "The attack affects a wide area and can affect several targets at once. The attack automatically affects any target within Reach of the initial target, and then one additional target within Close range for each Effect rolled, starting with th next closest target (at GMs discretion). If one or more Complications are rolled, GM may choose one of those complications to have the attack hit an ally within the area. Target may attempt Defend Reaction but must attempt a Challenging (D2) skill test. Success of one target does not cover other targets.",
  "CONAN.qualitiesDescriptionBack": "Attacks with this Quality are dangerous to the attacker as well as the enemy. An attack with this Quality inflicts X damage to the attacker for each Effect rolled. This damage ignores Soak and will be of whatever kind of damage the attack inflicts, unless otherwise stated.",
  "CONAN.qualitiesDescriptionBlin": "If an attack with this Quality inflicts one or more Harms, it instead inflicts the Blind condition, lasting until the end of the scene or until cleared by other means.",
  "CONAN.qualitiesDescriptionCava": "The attack is launched from horseback and inflicts tremendous damage. The attack inflicts X additional damage to the target for each Effect rolled so long as the attack was made as part of a mounted character's Charge Action.",
  "CONAN.qualitiesDescriptionFear": "The attack spreads doubt and panic, inflicting mental damage as well as physical damage. The attack inflicts X mental damage to the target for each Effect rolled, in addition to whatever physical damage was inflicted.",
  "CONAN.qualitiesDescriptionFrag": "These attacks can become less effective over time. For each Effect rolled, reduce the damage rating by 1 d6 after the attack concludes. If this would reduce the number to 0, then the attack cannot be used again until it has been replaced, repaired, or replenished.",
  "CONAN.qualitiesDescriptionGrap": "In addition to dealing damage, if one or more Effects are rolled the weapon may ensnare the target. An ensnared target is unable to move or take action except to attempt an Acrobatics or Athletics test with a Difficulty equal to the number of Effects rolled. Against an ensnared target, the Difficulty of the Exploit Action is reduced by one step. If the Grappling weapon is a melee weapon, the wielder may not attack with the weapon against anyone else while the target is ensnared. Further, the attacker may not move away from the target without releasing that target; can be released as a Free Action",
  "CONAN.qualitiesDescriptionHidd": "The attack is easy to conceal or designed to be disguised as something else. When the weapon is hidden, any search of the owning character requires an Observation test, with a Difficulty of X to locate it. Immediately after using this attack, the character may spend Momentum to conceal it quickly. This costs two Momentum for attacks with Hidden 1 or Hidden 2, and 1 point of Momentum for attacks with Hidden 3 or higher. This is used when the weapon is concealed, not when it is in use.",
  "CONAN.qualitiesDescriptionImpr": "This item is not designed as a weapon but can be used as such in an impromptu manner. It could be a heavy rock, a wooden torch, or a thick leg bone. When damage is rolled with this weapon, it does not score damage when an Effect is rolled. It is possible for an item to have both the Improvised and Vicious Qualities, cancelling out their effects, but both will be noted in case some factor causes the attack to increase its Vicious Quality, or to lose Improvised.",
  "CONAN.qualitiesDescriptionInce": "The target is set ablaze and gains the Burning Condition for a number of rounds equal to the number of Effects rolled. At the end of each of the target's turns, the target suffers X d6 physical damage to a random hit location and suffers the same amount of mental damage (roll once for both). Damage inflicted by Incendiary X ignores Soak. Any Effects rolled on this additional damage increase the number of rounds that the character is aflame, though a character can attempt to remove this condition early as normal.",
  "CONAN.qualitiesDescriptionInte": "These attacks are designed to inflict massive harm on a target, incapacitating them far more swiftly. If an Intense attack inflicts one or more Harms upon the target, then it inflicts one additional Harm.",
  "CONAN.qualitiesDescriptionKnoc": "The attack knocks the target prone if one or more Effects are rolled. The target may ignore this if they add 1 Doom for each Effect rolled, or in the case of NPCs, at the cost of 1 Doom per Effect rolled.",
  "CONAN.qualitiesDescriptionNonl": "The attack doesn't inflict lasting damage, instead inflicting a temporary penalty. The attack cannot inflict a normal Harm effect, but rather may only inflict temporary conditions. If the attack has no other Qualities that inflict an alternate Harm, then it inflicts the Dazed Condition until the end of the target's next turn.",
  "CONAN.qualitiesDescriptionPair": "When used in a pair, the weapons are greatly enhanced. Gaining the specified quality at the value of X. Weapons must be identical, or nearly so. The user cannot use two different weapons for this quality, even if each has the Paired Quality.",
  "CONAN.qualitiesDescriptionParr": "This weapon is extremely effective at deflecting other attacks. When wielding one or more weapons with this Quality, the Doom cost of making a Defend or Protect Reaction with the Parry skill is reduced by 1, to a minimum of 0.",
  "CONAN.qualitiesDescriptionPers": "The attack has a lingering, deleterious effect. If one or more Effects are rolled, the target will suffer X d6 damage at the start of each subsequent turn for a number of rounds equal to the number of Effects rolled. Each effect rolled on the ongoing damage adds one additional round of duration. This condition can be avoided entirely at the time it is inflicted by adding a number of points to Doom equal to the number of Effects rolled; after this, it can only be removed by waiting for the duration to end or by taking the Clear action.",
  "CONAN.qualitiesDescriptionPier": "This attack ignores X points of the target's total Soak for each Effect rolled.",
  "CONAN.qualitiesDescriptionShie": "Shields are extremely effective at affording protection from a range of different attacks. A shield counts as having the Parrying Quality. A shield also allows the wielder to use the Parry skill to make Defend Reactions against ranged attacks in addition to Melee attacks. Further if the Wielder has Guard, a shield grants the wielder X d6 Cover Soak against Melee and Ranged attacks. Finally, shields may be sacrificed in order to avoid suffering a Wound.",
  "CONAN.qualitiesDescriptionSpre": "This weapon is designed to affect a larger area. For each Effect generated, roll X additional hit locations. These additional hit locations suffer half of the attack's final damage, rounding up. In the case of non-player characters or beings where hit locations are not being used, the target takes the additional damage X times.",
  "CONAN.qualitiesDescriptionStun": "The attack inflicts the Staggered condition on the target, if one or more Effects are rolled. The condition lasts until the end of the target's next turn. The target may ignore this at the cost of 1 point of Doom for each Effect rolled.",
  "CONAN.qualitiesDescriptionSubt": "The attack is particularly quiet and draws little attention. Any Observation test to detect an attack with this weapon increases in DIfficulty by a number of steps equal to X. This differs from the Hidden Quality in that it is used when the weapon is used, versus when it is concealed.",
  "CONAN.qualitiesDescriptionThro": "The weapon can be thrown effectively. When throwing a melee weapon with the Thrown Quality, your character does not increase the Difficulty of the Ranged Weapons test. Some weapons may be listed as Thrown (M), in which case they are traeted as ranged weapons with a range of Medium when thrown.",
  "CONAN.qualitiesDescriptionUnfo": "If the target of this attack was affected by an Exploit action immediately before this attack was made, then this attack gains the Intense and Vicious X Qualities.",
  "CONAN.qualitiesDescriptionVici": "An attack with this Quality inflicts X additional damage for each Effect rolled.",
  "CONAN.qualitiesDescriptionVoll": "This ranged weapon can be used quickly, allowing the wielder to unleash volleys of projectiles. Thus, wielders often carry bundles of ammunition. An attack with a Volley weapon does not expend any Shots; the user has enough ammunition to last the fight, barring Complications. Further, a Load of ammunition can be spent to perform a Volley, adding a bonus d20 to Ranged Weapons tests to attack, and +1 to the weapon's damage if the attack hits. Loads may also be lost as the result of a Complication. After a fight, spent Loads can be recovered in the same way as Shots.",
  "CONAN.qualitiesDescriptionHeav": "Attempting any activity outside of combat in this Armor is exhausting and difficult. If wearing Heavy armor on three or more hit locations, your character suffers one additional Fatigue whenever suffering Fatigue normally. If hit locations are not being used, the armor is assumed to cover enough of the body to cause the additional fatigue.",
  "CONAN.qualitiesDescriptionNois": "Attempting stealth of any type in this armor is likely to fail. If your character is wearing Noisy armor on two or more hit locations, the Difficulty of all Stealth tests is increased by one step. If hit locations are not being used, the armor is assumed to cover enough of the body that the Difficulty penalty applies.",
  "CONAN.qualitiesDescriptionVHea": "This armor is considered as Heavy and Noisy armor. If worn as a full suit it increases the wearer's Courage Soak by 2, due to confidence gained from such sturdy protection. Very Heavy armor must be crafted to the wearer for greatest efficiency. A full suit of Very Heavy armor that has been crafted specifically for the wearer provides Reach 2, even when wielding no other weapons, allowing the character to have a significant advantage in close quarters combat.",
  "CONAN.qualitiesDescriptionAFra": "Whenever this armor is penetrated (wearer takes damage), roll equal to the Armor Soak in that location. If an Effect is rolled, the Armor Soak is reduced by 1 point for that location, to a minimum of 0. Repairs cost Gold equal to the Armor Soak the armor was reduced by, per location",
